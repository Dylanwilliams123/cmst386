          <h2>Describe how search engines work.</h2>
          <p>
            Search engines work by taking in data from keywords and crawling the
            internet in search of content that contains those keywords. These
            bots go through billions of webpages using data from those pages to
            find new URLs to add to their index. This information is stored so
            it can later be retrieved when the user searches for information
            that is contained on those web pages.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Keywords and descriptions as meta tags are very important for search
            engine optimization and accessibility. Having good keywords and meta
            data increases the chances of a user finding your site. This will
            lead to more traffic from users that have interest in your content,
            products, or services. The more specific your keywords and
            descriptions are the higher up your website will be ranked when
            searched.

          <p>
            The four elements that comprise writing relevant content links are
            technical SEO, Content, On-site SEO, and Off-site SEO. Search Engine
            Optimization is the most important part of writing relevant content.
            Making use of these four elements when writing your content will
            help get your website discovered.

            What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with
            more than one heading tag.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Good heading hierarchy is the way headings are structured on a page.
            The h1 tag is the largest heading and therefore will be at the top
            of the page. H2-H6 should cascade down naturally as they are needed.
            You should not skip levels when structuring your page. If you have
            your h1 heading and need a subheading you should use h2 and not skip
            to h3.
          </p>
          <p>For Example:</p>

          <h1>This is the H1 Heading</h1>
          <h2>This is the H2 Heading</h2>
          <h3>This is the H3 Heading</h3>
          <h4>This is the H4 Heading</h4>
          <h5>This is the H5 Heading</h5>
          <h6>This is the H6 Heading</h6>
