            Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the
            target audience.
          </h2>
          <p>
            A website may adapt to any screen size using responsive design. It
            eliminates the need to create and manage two distinct versions of
            your website and is just as user-friendly on mobile devices as it is
            on tablet and desktop computers. This has an influence on a target
            audience since it takes less time, saves loading time, works well on
            diverse devices, and makes all sites always available.

            Google Analytics provides a wealth of data for free to help assess
            the success of websites. Describe three different kinds of reports
            that will tell you what information your target audience is
            accessing .
          </h2>
          <p>
            You may focus your geographic targeting with the use of location
            reports. You may learn which towns, states, and nations are home to
            the people that visit your website. You can choose the right tone
            for your messaging by knowing if the majority of your website
            visitors are men or women. Knowing the gender and age of your target
            will help you write copy that will appeal to them more. Age reports
            are crucial because they let you decide which social media platforms
            to prioritize based on the average age of the visitors to your
            website. One of the greatest ways to determine where your audience
            spends the most time is based on age.
